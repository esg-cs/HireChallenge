CTF HireChallenge

- get/clone the git repo (download the zip and readme)
- Unpack the ZIP and Import the OVA to VBox or VMware
- The box will gather IP from DHCP, works with vbox / vmware.

- Do not cheat by using the virtualization to gain root access.
- Do not get the root flag through a recovery iso etc.
- The idea is to get root by attacking this machine remotely
over a network with no physical access.

Objective:

1) Find all flags - flags have the format flag{hint}
  each Flag contains a hint how to proceed.
  
2) Finally gain root privileges

3) Consider it over when reading the final flag and follow instructions

4) Document your steps made, tools used, commands fired and all the information gathered during this challenge.

Have Fun!
