# HireChallenge
CTF HireChallenge

- get/clone the git repo (download the zip and readme)
- Unpack the ZIP and Import the OVA to VBox or VMware
- The box will gather IP from DHCP, works with vbox / vmware.

- Do not cheat by using the virtualization to gain root access.
- Do not get the root flag through a recovery iso etc.
- The idea is to get root by attacking this machine remotely
over a network with no physical access.

Objective:
1) Find all hidden flags - flags have the format flag{hint}
  each Flag contains a hint how to proceed. There are 8 main flags and 2 bonus flags.
2) Finally gain root privileges
3) Consider it over when reading /root/final.txt and follow instructions
4) Document your steps made, tools used, commands fired and all the information gathered during this challenge.

Have Fun!
